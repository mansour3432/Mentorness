# Game Analysis with SQL

This repository contains the project files related to the game analysis project conducted during the internship at Mentorness Company. The project utilizes SQL for data analysis and visualization.
## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to analyze game data using SQL queries. The dataset consists of tables related to player information, game levels, and game statistics. By querying this dataset, various analyses can be performed, such as player performance, level difficulty analysis, and player engagement metrics.
## Contents

The repository contains the following files:

    game_analysis.sql: SQL file containing queries used for data analysis.
    presentation.pptx: PowerPoint presentation summarizing the findings and insights derived from the analysis.
    presentation_video.mp4: Video presentation discussing the content of the PowerPoint presentation.

### Usage

    SQL Queries: The Game Analysis.sql file contains SQL queries for analyzing the game data. These queries can be executed in any SQL-compatible database environment, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

    Presentation: The Game Analysis Presentation.pptx file provides a detailed overview of the analysis findings, insights, and visualizations.

    Presentation Video: The Game Analysis Video Presentation.zip file is a video presentation accompanying the PowerPoint slides. It elaborates on the content of the slides and provides additional context and explanations.

### How to Use

To replicate the analysis or explore the data further, follow these steps:

    Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
    Open the Game Analysis.sql file in a SQL-compatible environment.
    Execute the SQL queries to analyze the provided dataset.
    Review the Game Analysis Presentation.pptx file for a summary of the analysis findings.
    Optionally, watch the Game Analysis Video Presentation.mp4 for a detailed explanation of the presentation slides.
