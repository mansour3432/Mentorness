# Internship Project: Airplane Crash Data Analysis with Power BI

## Welcome to the repository for the airplane crash data analysis project conducted during the internship at Mentorness Company.
## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing airplane crash data using Power BI to derive actionable insights. The goal is to provide stakeholders in the aviation industry with valuable information to enhance safety measures and decision-making processes.
## Files
### Power BI File

The main component of this project is the Power BI file (Airplane Crash Analysis last.pbix), which contains the visualizations, dashboards, and data connections used to analyze the airplane crash dataset.
### PowerPoint Presentation

Accompanying the Power BI file is a PowerPoint presentation (Airplane Crash Analysis ppt.pptx) summarizing the key findings and insights derived from the analysis. This presentation is designed to effectively communicate the results to stakeholders.
### Video Presentation

Additionally, there is a video presentation available in the repository (Airplane Crash Analysis Video Presentation.zip). In this video, the PowerPoint presentation is narrated to provide a detailed explanation of the analysis and its implications.
### Project Scope

The project primarily focuses on analyzing historical airplane crash data without involving feature engineering or data modeling techniques. The emphasis is on visualizing trends, patterns, and insights from the raw data using Power BI.
### Usage

To explore the analysis and findings:

    Open the Power BI file (Airplane Crash Analysis last.pbix) using Power BI Desktop.
    Navigate through the different pages and visualizations to explore the insights derived from the airplane crash data.
    Refer to the PowerPoint presentation (Airplane Crash Analysis ppt.pptx) for a summarized overview of the analysis.
    Watch the video presentation (Airplane Crash Analysis Video Presentation.zip) for a narrated explanation of the analysis and its implications.
